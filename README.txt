HOW TO RUN:
    To run the springboot application, simply run the class named SpringbootApplication.
    To run the react application, run the command 'npm start --port 3000' under /src/main/frontend.
        NOTE: This requires Node.js to be installed. Version used during implementation was '22.14.0'

    Both applications must be running for the app to function.
    If you encounter any issues, let us know.
